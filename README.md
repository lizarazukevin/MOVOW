# MOVOW

First software project designed by Spicy Technologies, MOVOW is a play on words combining movies and viewership to create the ultimate social media for movies and shows. 

Streaming services have isolated the viewing experience among their userbase, we want to bridge that gap and be able to create a collaborative space in real-time to support the exploration and celebration of film among friends! 

Our design philosophy is agile development powered with CI/CD pipelines that help our team push changes and have complete control over our product and its services to our users and stakeholders.
